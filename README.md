# The Road Trip Crazies

## Brief Description

The Road Trip Crazies is a group of people who volunteer a few weekends out of the year to go on a road trip to help Habitat for Humanity build houses.  The "Crazies" will blitz build at least one house with the local community in 2.5 days.  THis is an app to help them stay connected using a list style timeline, and a chat room that users can log into and check/ write in.
